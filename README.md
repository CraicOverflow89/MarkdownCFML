MarkdownCFML
============
A markdown interpreter written purely in CFML. Currently a **work in progress** - I will update this as and when.

#### Setup
Call the `markdown()` function, passing in the path to a markdown file.

#### Further Reading
I have been using [this markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) as a guide to markdown syntax.

#### Error Handling
There are currently lots of places where incorrect syntax will cause errors throughout the document - I will attempt to add better error handling later.

#### Feedback
Feel free to share questions/comments.
